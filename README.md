#### About Me
I'm a full stack developer with experience in JavaScript, Ruby, HTML, CSS, Ruby on Rails, React, ActiveRecord, SQL, Version Control Systems, UI Design Command Lines, Debugging, Object Oriented Design.

I have worked in the performing arts field for over 15 years, performing and teaching as a classical bassoonist. I achieved success as a classical musician through deep focus and dedication over many years, both as a student and into my career as a professional. It requires a near-obsession but the payoff is a fulfilling sense of ownership and respect for my work.

As a software engineer I find the the intersection of these two complex worlds - music and code - fascinating. I'm obsessed with efficiency in my code on one hand, and readability on the other. It takes a certain artistry and balance to achieve both. Whatever the ineffable qualities, you know when you see great code and you know when you hear great music. 

When I'm not coding or playing bassoon you can find me outside, hanging off a boulder, skiing down a mountain, or camping under the stars.
